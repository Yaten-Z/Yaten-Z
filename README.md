# Hi, I'm Yaten

A student developer with a deep interest in computers.

## About Me

I am a ninth-grade student from Guangdong, China. I enjoy learning new technologies, exploring through hands-on projects, and gradually turning ideas into reality. During my studies, I actively participate in open-source projects. I have also joined the TATEN team, where I collaborate, learn, and develop projects alongside like-minded middle school students. Through this experience, I have gained valuable insights.

I continuously engage in various projects to enhance my development skills. Feel free to browse my repository to see what I'm currently building, refactoring, or experimenting with.
